# Assignment 1
 Task 1
- Task: Write a program in Python, to read the Tweet Dataset from MongoDB. Then for each Tweet,
extract keywords from the text of the Tweet. Then for each Tweet, add a new name/value pair to store
the keywords in a comma-separated value (CSV) format; and update the original Tweet in the MongoDB.
Task 2: 
- MapReduce: Calculate the count of number of occurrences of each word in the text of Tweets.
- Create a short documentation in which you briefly describe your implementation:
Task 3: 
-  MapReduce: Calculate the count of number of tweets for a list of different cities in Australia.
-  Create a short documentation in which you briefly describe your implementation:
Task 4: 
-  MapReduce: Implement the Merge Sort3 algorithm using Map-Reduce.
-  MapReduce: Implement the Bucket Sort4 algorithm using Map-Reduce.
Task 5:
• MapReduce: Implement the TF-IDF algorithm using Map-Reduce for the term “health” in the text of
the Tweets.
• Create a short documentation in which you briefly describe your implementation:
o How many MapReduce Jobs? Why?
o What to write in the mapper(s) ? Flowchart and Pseudocode !
o What to write in the reducer(s) ? Flowchart and Pseudocode !
